            <h1>The Amazing Life Of James Parkert</h1>
            <h2>James Parker beginings</h2>
            <p>I was born on June 27 2010 in wellington, and I lived in outer Ngaio until I was about 1, after which we moved into more central Ngaio. I attended grace kindergarten in the end of 2012 until 2014. One of my first friends was Luke Gardner, I was invited to his birthday but then I became closer friends with his younger brother who was closer to my age, Jacob. In oKindergarten, I was friends with Braedon MacDonald, Harry West, and xxx. I left kindergarten in 2014, when I started year 0 at Ngaio School. I was in a class with someone who stayed my friend throughout primary school, Aden Winther. I was 6 when I started playing my first instrument, piano. Shortly after that, at Christmas 2016 I got my first guitar. I started to take classical lessons with the same guitar teacher I have now. I led the kapa haka at my school in year 6. I went on quite a few camps with the YMCA when I was younger, when on my second one met Ben Macmillan. I went to raroa intermediate for years 7 and 8, and this is when I started to really love playing music. I was involved in the rock bands in both of my years there, in the first I was in a band called Queen Green, and we played all you need is love by the Beatles. I played in the school orchestra, initially on electric bass for year 7, until year 8 when the conductor asked if I could play double bass for one of the pieces, I said yes and he started giving me lessons. Little did I know he was an NZSO bassist who is still my teacher. I played double bass in year 8, and was still involved on guitar in the rock bands. We were called Letters From The Other Side and we played sweet child o mine for the showcase, where i was on lead guitar. The piece was challenging but extremely fun and rewarding. Both year 7 and 8 showcase were extremely busy for me. I was performing with the kapa haka, leading it, I was also in the orchestra, and rock bands. I started year 9 at onslow college alongside my friends. I played in the junior cricket xi, and the junior second xi football team, as keeper. I won an Onslow College high achiever for being selected in the year 9 pathway development programme for cricket. In year 10 I motved to wellington college. I played in the Prem 4 Gold cricket team, and the year 10 second xi as a goalkeeper. I was selected for the pathway development programme again for cricket. I received an attainment in French and was first in my class. I also received an attainment in music. I was the recipient of the dean’s endeavour for academic excellence award. I was MVP of my cricket team. I won the school values award for music.</p>
